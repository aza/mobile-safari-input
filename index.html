      <p>1. Purr chase mice sit in window and stare ooo, a bird! yum, use lap as
        chair, for always hungry so stare at ceiling light. Curl into a furry
        donut.</p>

      <p>2. Jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass meow meow, i tell my human but meowing non stop for food. Meow to be let in meowing non stop for food. Stick butt in face go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway so nap all day, for destroy the blinds destroy couch as revenge. Stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring rub face on everything sleep on keyboard, for meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans.
      </p>

      <p>3. Purr for no reason refuse to leave cardboard box and claw drapes, or fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) cats go for world domination if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish. Human give me attention meow sleep on keyboard go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway or lounge in doorway or eat owner's food, leave dead animals as gifts. Mark territory damn that dog hack up furballs, bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face and walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield.</p>

      <p>4. Chew iPad power cord scratch the box dream about hunting birds. Lay on arms while you're using the keyboard instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason or hunt anything that moves scratch the box. </p>

      <p>5. Shake treat bag lick the other cats so hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser and rub face on owner. Intrigued by the shower meow, or eat a plant, kill a hand. Poop in litter box, scratch the walls leave fur on owners clothes. Gate keepers of hell sit by the fire and scamper for purr for no reason yet sleep in the bathroom sink. Favor packaging over toy. Climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face poop in the plant pot and always hungry find something else more interesting lick butt, or get video posted to internet for chasing red dot so chase imaginary bugs. <p>

    // Global for storing state and stuff. Ugly, but good enough for a hack.
    var data = {}

    var headerEl = $('.header'),
        footerEl = $('.footer')

    // Grab the current scroll position before the input is focused. Needed
    // because window.scrollY gets messed up by the time onFocus is invoked.

      headerEl.hide() // prevent header scroll flicker
    })

    $('#input').on('focus', e => {


      // Wait until the keyboard has slid up, which means window.scrollY will
      // have taken a new position. A more robust version of this wouldn't use
      // a timeout, but instead wait for window.scrollY to have changed.
      setTimeout( () => {

        window.scrollTo( 0, window.scrollY-10 ) // 10 seems to work across all iPhones, not sure why 10...
        // With the above scroll trick, the footer is now positioned flush against the top
        // of the keyboard. This means we can use it to compute the height of the
        // keyboard and the actual window.innerHeight!
        var windowHeight = footerEl.position().top + footerEl.height()
        data.keyboardHeight = window.innerHeight - windowHeight
        data.windowInnerHeightWithKeyboard = windowHeight

        $('.footer').css({top: data.prefocusScrollY + data.windowInnerHeightWithKeyboard - $('.footer').height() })

        setTimeout( () => { headerEl.show() }, 100) // reshow header after scrolling is completed

    $('#input').on('blur', e => {
      $('.header').css({top:0})
      $('.footer').css({top:'auto', bottom: 0})
    })

    // Interesting discovery:
    //
    // Calling `window.scrollBy(0,0)` within input.onFocus, and then return,
    // causes there to be no funky change/scroll on input focus. This may be
    // useful, but doesn't help in knowing where to position the footer,
    // and doesn't allow us to calculate the keyboard height
    //
    // If we have a map of iPhone's to keyboard heights then perhaps this
    // may be a promising direction.
